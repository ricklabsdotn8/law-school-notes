* duces tecum

    Subpoena Duces Tecum: This type of subpoena requires the recipient to produce specific documents, records, or tangible items that are relevant to a legal proceeding. "Duces tecum" is Latin for "bring with you." The subpoena will specify the documents or items required, and the recipient is obligated to gather and present them at the designated time and place.

    - Grounds for quashing:
        1. The subpoena duces tecum is unreasonable and oppressive. [e.g. “Mr. Manager you are required to bring to court all your ledgers, all your receipts, and all your documents from 1990 to the present.”]

        2. The books, documents or things sought to be produced do not appear to be relevant to the issues. [e.g. In a collection case, you were required to bring your birth certificate, marriage contract.]

        3. The person asking for the subpoena fails to advance the reasonable cost of production of the articles desired.

        4. The witness fees and kilometrage were not tendered when the subpoena was served (Rule 21, Sec. 4)

* ad testificandum

    Subpoena Ad Testificandum: This type of subpoena compels an individual to appear and testify as a witness in a legal proceeding. "Ad testificandum" is Latin for "to testify." The subpoena will require the recipient to appear in court or at a deposition and provide testimony under oath.
