## RULE 3 - PARTIES TO CIVIL ACTIONS

### **Section 1. Who may be parties; plaintiff and defendant.**
Only *natural or juridical persons*, or *entities authorized by law* **may be parties in a civil action**. The term **plaintiff** may refer to the *claiming party, the counter-claimant, the cross-claimant, or the third (fourth, etc.)[-]party plaintiff*. The term **defendant** may refer to the *original defending party, the defendant in a counterclaim, the cross-defendant, or the third (fourth, etc.)[-]party defendant.* (1a)

### **Section 2. Parties in interest.**
A **real party in interest** is the *party who stands to **be benefited or injured** by the judgment in the suit*, or the *party entitled **to the avails of the suit***. Unless otherwise authorized by law or these Rules, every action **must be prosecuted or defended** *in the name of the real party in interest*.

### **Section 3. Representatives as parties.**
Where the action is *allowed to be prosecuted or defended* **by a representative or someone acting in a fiduciary capacity**, the *beneficiary* shall be *included in the title of the case* and shall be *deemed to be the real party in interest*. A **representative** may be a *trustee of an express trust*, *a guardian*, *an executor or administrator*, or* a party authorized by law* or these Rules. An **agent acting in his own name** and **for the benefit of an undisclosed principal** *may sue or be sued without joining the principal* **except when the contract involves things belonging to the principal.** (3a)

### **Section 4. Spouses as parties.**
Husband and wife *shall sue or be sued **jointly***, except as provided by law. (4a)

### **Section 5. Minor or incompetent persons.**
A **minor** or a **person alleged to be incompetent**, *may sue or be sued*, **with the assistance** of *his father, mother, guardian, or if he has none, a guardian ad litem*. (5a)

### **Section 6. Permissive joinder of parties**.
All persons **in whom or against whom** *any right to relief in respect to or arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions* is alleged to exist, *whether jointly, severally, or in the alternative*, may, except as otherwise provided in these Rules, **join as plaintiffs or be joined as defendants in one complaint**, *where any question of law or fact* **common to all such plaintiffs or to all such defendants** may arise in the action; but the court may make such orders as may be just to **prevent any plaintiff or defendant from *being embarrassed or put to expense*** in connection with any *proceedings in which he may have no interest*. (6)

### **Section 7. Compulsory joinder of indispensable parties.**
Parties in interest *without whom* **no final determination can be had of an action** shall be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants. (7)

### **Section 8. Necessary party.**
A **necessary party** is one who is *not indispensable* but who ought to be joined as a party **if complete relief is to be accorded as to those already parties**, or *for a complete determination or settlement* of the **claim subject of the action**. (8a)

### **Section 9. Non-joinder of necessary parties to be pleaded.** 
Whenever in any pleading in which a claim is asserted **a *necessary party* is not joined**, *the pleader shall set forth his name*, if known, *and shall state why he is omitted*. Should the court find the *reason for the omission unmeritorious*, it may order the *inclusion of the omitted necessary party* if jurisdiction over his person may be obtained.

The *failure to comply with the order for his inclusion*, without justifiable cause, shall be *deemed a waiver of the claim against such party*.

The *non-inclusion of a **necessary party*** *does not prevent* the court from proceeding in the action, and the judgment rendered therein shall be *s*. (8a, 9a)
