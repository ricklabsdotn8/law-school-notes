> ## GENERAL PROVISIONS

### **Sec. 51.** *Conveyance and other dealings by registered owner.* 
An owner of registered land may *convey, mortgage, lease, charge or otherwise deal* with the same in accordance with existing laws. 

He may use such forms of deeds, mortgages, leases or other voluntary instruments as are sufficient in law. 

But **no deed, mortgage, lease, or other voluntary instrument**, *except a will purporting to convey or affect registered land* shall *take effect as a conveyance or bind the land*, but shall operate only as a *contract between the parties* and as *evidence of authority* **to** the Register of Deeds to make registration.

The **act of registration** shall be the *operative act to convey or affect* the land insofar as *third persons* are concerned, and in all cases under this Decree, the registration shall be made in the office of the Register of Deeds for the **province or city where the land lies**.

### **Sec. 52.** *Constructive notice upon registration.*
**Every conveyance, mortgage, lease, lien, attachment, order, judgment, instrument or entry** affecting registered land **shall**, 

*if registered, filed or entered in the office of the Register of Deeds* for the province or city where the land to which it relates lies, 

be **constructive notice to all** persons *from the time of such registering, filing or entering*.

### **Sec. 53.** *Presentation of owner's duplicate upon entry of new certificate.* 
**No voluntary instrument shall be registered** by the Register of Deeds,

*unless the owner's duplicate certificate is presented with such instrument*, 

**except** in cases expressly provided for in this Decree or upon order of the court, for cause shown.
