# CHAPTER V - SUBSEQUENT REGISTRATION

## I. VOLUNTARY DEALINGS WITH REGISTERED LANDS
> ## GENERAL PROVISIONS

### **Sec. 51.** *Conveyance and other dealings by registered owner.* 
An owner of registered land may *convey, mortgage, lease, charge or otherwise deal* with the same in accordance with existing laws. 

He may use such forms of deeds, mortgages, leases or other voluntary instruments as are sufficient in law. 

But **no deed, mortgage, lease, or other voluntary instrument**, *except a will purporting to convey or affect registered land* shall *take effect as a conveyance or bind the land*, but shall operate only as a *contract between the parties* and as *evidence of authority* **to** the Register of Deeds to make registration.

The **act of registration** shall be the *operative act to convey or affect* the land insofar as *third persons* are concerned, and in all cases under this Decree, the registration shall be made in the office of the Register of Deeds for the **province or city where the land lies**.

***

### **Sec. 52.** *Constructive notice upon registration.*
**Every conveyance, mortgage, lease, lien, attachment, order, judgment, instrument or entry** affecting registered land **shall**, 

*if registered, filed or entered in the office of the Register of Deeds* for the province or city where the land to which it relates lies, 

be **constructive notice to all** persons *from the time of such registering, filing or entering*.

***

### **Sec. 53.** *Presentation of owner's duplicate upon entry of new certificate.* 
**No voluntary instrument shall be registered** by the Register of Deeds,

*unless the owner's duplicate certificate is presented with such instrument*, 

**except** in cases expressly provided for in this Decree or upon order of the court, for cause shown.

**The production of the owner's duplicate certificate**, whenever any voluntary instrument is presented for registration, 

**shall be conclusive authority from the registered owner to the Register of Deeds** *to enter a new certificate or to make a memorandum of registration* in accordance with such instrument, 

and *the new certificate or memorandum shall be binding upon the registered owner* and upon *all persons claiming under him*, in favor of every purchaser for value and in good faith.

In *all cases of registration **procured by fraud***, the owner *may pursue all his **legal and equitable remedies** against the **parties to such fraud***

**without prejudice**, however, *to the rights of **any innocent holder for value*** of a certificate of title. 

After the entry of the decree of registration on the original petition or application, *any subsequent registration procured by the presentation of a **forged duplicate certificate of title**, or a **forged deed or other instrument***, shall be **null and void**.

***

### **Sec. 54.** *Dealings less than ownership, how registered.*
*No new certificate shall be entered or issued* pursuant *to any instrument which **does not divest the ownership or title*** from the owner or from the transferee of the registered owners.

*All interests* in registered land *less than ownership* shall be registered by *filing* with the Register of Deeds *the instrument which creates or transfers or claims such interests* and by a *brief memorandum* thereof made by the Register of Deeds *upon the certificate of title*, and *signed by him*. 

A *similar memorandum* shall also be *made on the owner's duplicate*.

The *cancellation or extinguishment* of such interests *shall be registered **in the same manner***.

***

### **Sec. 55.** *Grantee's name, nationality, etc., to be stated*.
*Every deed or other voluntary instrument* presented for registration *shall contain or have endorsed upon* it the 
> full name,
>
> nationality,
>
> residence and 
>
> postal address 

*of the grantee or other person acquiring or claiming an interest* under such instrument, 

and **every deed** shall also state whether the grantee is 
> married or unmarried, and if married, the name in full of the husband or wife. 

If the grantee is a 
> corporation or association, 

**the instrument must contain a recital** to show that such corporation or association **is legally qualified to acquire private lands**. 

*Any change in the residence or postal address of such person* **shall be endorsed** by the Register of Deeds *on the original copy* of the corresponding certificate of title, *upon receiving a sworn statement of such change*. All names and addresses shall also be entered on all certificates.

**Notices and processed issued** *in relation to registered land* in pursuance of this Decree *may be served upon any person in interest by mailing* the same to the addresses given, and **shall be binding, whether such person resides *within or without the Philippines***, but the court may, in its discretion, require further or other notice to be given in any case, if in its opinion the interest of justice so requires.
